## Introduction

This report presents a statistical analysis of banana data. The goal is to explore the relationships between various characteristics of bananas and their quality.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Data Loading



```{r }
# Load the banana data
banana_data <- read_csv("banana.csv")
head(banana_data)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Summary Statistics

Let's begin with some summary statistics for each variable.

```{r summary-stats}
summary(banana_data)
```

### Visualizing Distributions with Histograms

Histograms provide a quick way to visualize the distribution of each numerical variable.

```{r histogram-plots, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
# Plotting histograms for each numerical variable
num_vars <- c("Size", "Weight", "Sweetness", "Softness", "Ripeness", "Acidity", "HarvestTime")
for (var in num_vars) {
  print(ggplot(banana_data, aes_string(x = var)) + 
          geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") + 
          theme_minimal() + 
          ggtitle(paste("Histogram of", var)))
}
```

### QQ Plots for Assessing Normality

QQ plots help in assessing if the variables follow a normal distribution.

```{r qq-plots}
# Generating QQ plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
for (var in num_vars[-7]) { # Excluding 'HarvestTime'
  qqnorm(banana_data[[var]], main = paste("QQ Plot of", var))
  qqline(banana_data[[var]])
}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

### Pairwise Scatterplots

Investigate the relationships between variables with pairwise scatterplots.

```{r scatterplot-matrix}
pairs(~ Size + Weight + Sweetness + Softness + Ripeness + Acidity, data = banana_data)
```

### Boxplots by Quality

Boxplots are excellent for comparing distributions between two or more groups.

```{r boxplots-quality, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
for (var in num_vars[-7]) { # Excluding 'HarvestTime'
  print(ggplot(banana_data, aes(x = Quality, y = banana_data[[var]], fill = Quality)) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_minimal() +
          ggtitle(paste("Boxplot of", var, "by Quality")))
}
```

## Further Analysis

Based on the initial EDA, you might want to explore specific hypotheses or relationships further. For instance, comparing the characteristics of bananas with 'HarvestTime' above and below the median.

```{r further-analysis}
# Example: Comparing 'Size' based on 'HarvestTime' median split
median_harvest_time <- median(banana_data$HarvestTime)
banana_data$HarvestTimeGroup <- ifelse(banana_data$HarvestTime > median_harvest_time, "Above Median", "Below Median")

ggplot(banana_data, aes(x = HarvestTimeGroup, y = Size, fill = HarvestTimeGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Size by HarvestTime Groups")
```

## Conclusion

In this report, we conducted a preliminary exploration of the banana dataset, focusing on the relationships between various characteristics and banana quality. Further analyses are recommended to explore identified trends and hypotheses.

### Notes for Running the Rmd Document:

- Make sure to install the necessary packages (`readr`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`) using `install.packages()` if you haven't already.
- Adjust the file path to `"banana.csv"` as needed based on where your data file is located.
- This Rmd document is structured to render as an HTML document, which is versatile and easy to share. You can change the output to PDF or Word by modifying the `output:`
